# React Mini Projects

Welcome to my collection of **React mini apps**! üéØ

This repository is where I practice and sharpen my React skills by building small, focused projects.  
Each mini app explores different features or concepts in React ‚Äî like hooks, state management, routing, API calls, and more.

### Why this repo?

- üí° To experiment and learn by doing
- üõ†Ô∏è To build a hands-on understanding of React
- üöÄ To track my growth over time

Feel free to check them out, clone, or get inspired!

> Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è and a lot of `console.log()`s
